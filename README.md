## Future Work

- [ ] This application can be extended for many other Engineering Entrance Exams like JEE, etc.
- [ ] The User Interface can be made more user friendly though we have tried to create an execellent UI as per our imagination.
- [ ] The application can also be used to host some practice mock exams which will help the students to have more good practice before actua exams.
